# Programming Challenge: Freelancer Rates [freelancer-rates]

## Overview

Welcome to the Freelancer Rates Programming Challenge! This challenge will introduce you to variables, data types, and basic calculations in JavaScript. You'll build a program to calculate a freelancer's total earnings based on their hourly rate and the number of hours worked.

## Challenge Description

The objective of this challenge is to create a program that calculates a freelancer's total earnings. The program should:

- Prompt the user to enter their hourly rate (as a number).
- Prompt the user to enter the number of hours worked (as a number).
- Calculate the freelancer's total earnings by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked.
- Display the total earnings to the console with a descriptive message (e.g., "Your total earnings for this project are: $").

## Requirements

- Use `prompt` to get user input for the hourly rate and number of hours worked.
- Convert the user input from strings to numbers using `parseFloat`.
- Create a variable to store the calculated total earnings.
- Use `console.log` to display the total earnings with a descriptive message.

## Example Output

The program should prompt the user for input and then display the calculated earnings. Here's an example:

```
Enter your hourly rate: 50
Enter the number of hours worked: 10
Your total earnings for this project are: $500
```


## Bonus Challenge

Extend the program to allow the user to specify the currency for the total earnings (e.g., USD, EUR). Display the currency symbol alongside the calculated amount.
